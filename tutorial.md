# GCP CI/CD security demo and tutorial
This repo demostrates a security focused CI/CD pipeline for GKE with Google Cloud tools Cloud Build, Binary Authorization, Artifact Registry, Container Analysis, and Google Cloud Deploy.

## Select a project

<walkthrough-project-setup billing="true"></walkthrough-project-setup>

Once you've selected a project, click "Start".

## Set the PROJECT_ID environment variable

Set the PROJECT_ID environment variable. This variable will be used in forthcoming steps.
```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<walkthrough-project-id/>
```

### Enable needed APIs and Create Google Cloud Deploy pipeline
The 
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="bootstrap/init.sh">bootstrap/init.sh</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
script enables your APIs, customizes your 
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="clouddeploy.yaml">
clouddeploy.yaml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file> 
and creates a Cloud Deploy pipeline for you. You'll still need to do some steps manually after these scripts run, though.

Run the initialization script:
```bash
. ./bootstrap/init.sh
```

### View your Google Cloud Deploy Pipeline

Verify that the Google Cloud Deploy pipeline was created in the 
[Google Cloud Deploy UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines)

## Authorize your docker to push/pull to Artifact registry
Before you can push or pull images, configure Docker to use the Google Cloud CLI to authenticate requests to Artifact Registry.

To set up authentication to Docker repositories in the region europe-west1, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Turn on automated container vulnerability analysis
Google Cloud Container Analysis can be set to automatically scan for vulnerabilities on push (see [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/pricing)). 

Enable Container Analysis API for automated scanning:

<walkthrough-enable-apis apis="containerscanning.googleapis.com"></walkthrough-enable-apis>

## Configure your Github.com repo

If you have not forked this repo yet, please do so now:

[Fork this repo on Github](https://github.com/vszal/gcp-secure-cicd/fork)

To keep file changes you make in Cloud Shell in sync with your repo, you can check these file changes into your new Github repo by following these [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github). Note that the Github CLI is available in Cloud Shell.


## Setup a Cloud Build trigger for your repo
Now that your Github repo is setup, configure Cloud Build to run each time a change is pushed to the main branch. To do this, add a Trigger in Cloud Build:
1. Navigate to [Cloud Build triggers page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers)
2. Follow the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/build-repos-from-github) and create a Github App connected repo and trigger.
3. Configuration --> Type: select "Cloud Build configuration file"
4. Configuration --> Location: ensure Repository and "/cloudbuild.yaml" is selected.

## Create GKE clusters
You'll need GKE clusters to deploy to. The Google Cloud Deploy pipeline in this example refers to two clusters:
* test-sec
* prod-sec

Feel free to add more clusters, just update the clouddeploy.yaml file with the additional steps and targets. If you have/want different cluster names update cluster definitions in:
* <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="bootstrap/gke-init.sh">bootstrap/gke-init.sh</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
* <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="clouddeploy.yaml">clouddeploy.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
* <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="bootstrap/gke-delete.sh">bootstrap/gke-delete.sh</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Make sure you have Binary Authorization enabled for any existing clusters you may want to use.

### Create GKE clusters

```bash
. ./bootstrap/gke-init.sh
```

Note that these clusters are created asynchronously, so check on the [GKE UI]("https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview") periodically to ensure that the clusters are up before submitting your first release to Google Cloud Deploy.

## IAM and service account setup
You must give Cloud Build explicit permission to trigger a Google Cloud Deploy release.
1. Read the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating)
2. Navigate to [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) and locate your Cloud Build service account. Add these two roles
  * Cloud Deploy Releaser
  * Service Account User
3. Locate your Compute service account. Add thos role
  * Cloud Deploy Runner

## Kritis Signer and attestor setup

As part of the CI/CD pipeline, the image generated will be scanned for vulnerabilities. We’ll be using Kritis Signer as a “Cloud Builder” to vet created images against a vulnerability threshold policy and fail our builds if the vulnerability threshold is exceeded.


Follow the [doc steps](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/creating-attestations-kritis#set_up_the_kritis_signer_custom_builder) to create a Kritis signer custom builder image:
* Navigate outside the secure-cicd-maven project area and clone the Kritis repo
* Navigate into the Kritis folder
* Create your Kritis signer cloud builder (this will push the Kritis signer image to gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT/kritis:latest).

## Set up the Kritis Signer Binary Authorization attestor

Beyond just failing the build, we can also have Kritis Signer create a Binary Authorization attestation that the image passed vulnerability thresholds. This will be used for admission control during deployment later.	


1. Create signing keys used, steps 1 and 2 in [this doc](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/binary-auth-with-cloud-build-and-gke#creating_signing_keys):
* Create a key ring, make note of the resource location
* Create a signing signing key, make note of the resource location

2. Create the vulnerability signing note and attestor [per these docs, steps 1-6](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/binary-auth-with-cloud-build-and-gke#create_the_vulnerability_scanner_attestation)
Please name your attestor “vulnz-attestor” during step 3.
* Make note of the attestor's "note" resource location


3. Verify that your new attestor appears in the [console UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization/attestors):
If you’ve already created your Kritis signer Cloud Builder in the previous section, then you should see two attestors:
* vulnz-attestor (Your newly created attestor)
* built-by-cloud-build attestor (system generated)

## Setup Binary Authorization policy

Now that you have some attestors, you can create a Binary Authorization policy that restricts deployments to only those images that have the two attestations.

1. From the root of the repo, run:

```bash
gcloud container binauthz policy import policy/binauthz/attestor-policy.yaml
```

2. Verify that your policy is in place by visiting the [Binary Authorization UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization/policy).

For more docs, see: https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/setting-up

## Add substitutions to the Cloud Build Trigger
During a previous step you created a Github trigger for the build. While the following substitutions can be added directly to the cloudbuild file, it’s a bit safer to add these to the trigger itself.

1. Open the [Cloud Build trigger UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers;region=europe-west1)
* Find and edit your trigger in the UI. If you don’t see it, make sure you select the region you set up the trigger in.

2. Click the 3 dots menu → Edit

3. Scroll to the Advanced section and add these three variables:
* Variable 1: _KMS_DIGEST_ALG (value will be "SHA512" or "SHA256", depending on your key)
* Variable 2: _KMS_KEY_NAME (value will look like: projects/galloro-demos/locations/global/keyRings/RING-NAME/cryptoKeys/YOUR-KEY/cryptoKeyVersions/1)
* Variable 3: _NOTE_NAME (value will look like: projects/galloro-demos/notes/NOTE-NAME)

You can find the last two values in the vulnz-attestor in the [Binary Authorization attestor list UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization/attestors?). 

## Set up a Cloud Build private pool
[Private pools](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview) provide added security where builds will run with custom parameters including networks (VPC peering).

1. Go to the [Cloud Build worker pool UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/settings/worker-pool)
2. Click Create
3. Use these parameters:
* Name: private-pool
* Region: europe-west1
* Machine type: e2-medium
* Available disk size: 100 GB
* Project: (leave blank)
* Network: (leave blank)
* Assign external IPs: checked
4. Click save
